Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dmitry and I'm a backend engineer focusing on Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL and GraphQL. At my spare time I'm trying to learn Haskell and functional approach in general. Don't hesistate to ask me questions ðŸ™‚

I contribute to various openâ€“source projects ([Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ADmitryTsepelev+), [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ADmitryTsepelev+) and [many more](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ADmitryTsepelev+archived%3Afalse+is%3Apublic)). Also, I maintain my own libraries:

- [store_model](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/store_model) allows you to wrap JSON-backed DB columns with ActiveModel-like classes;
- [ar_lazy_preload](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/ar_lazy_preload) brings association lazy load functionality to your Rails applications;
- [graphql-ruby-persisted_queries](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/graphql-ruby-persisted_queries) is the implementation of [persisted queries](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-persisted-queries) for [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby);
- [graphql-ruby-fragment_cache](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/graphql-ruby-fragment_cache) powers up [graphql-ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org) with the ability to cache response fragments;
- [rubocop-graphql](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/rubocop-graphql) [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) extension for enforcing [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) best practices;
- [io_monitor](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/io_monitor) a gem that helps to detect potential memory bloats.
