I maintain a number of more or less popular libraries in Ruby ecosystem.

Rails tooling:

- [store_model](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/store_model) allows you to wrap JSON-backed DB columns with ActiveModel-like classes;
- [ar_lazy_preload](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/ar_lazy_preload) brings association lazy load functionality to your Rails applications;
- [io_monitor](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/io_monitor) is a gem that helps to detect potential memory bloats;

GraphQL toolbox:

- [graphql-ruby-persisted_queries](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/graphql-ruby-persisted_queries) is the implementation of [persisted queries](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-persisted-queries) for [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby);
- [graphql-ruby-fragment_cache](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/graphql-ruby-fragment_cache) powers up [graphql-ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org) with the ability to cache response fragments;
- [rubocop-graphql](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/rubocop-graphql) is a [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) extension for enforcing [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) best practices;

Code quality:

- [rubocop_director](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/rubocop_director) is a gem for preparing a refactoring plan based on [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) and git stats.

Experiments:

- [transducers-rb](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/transducers-rb) is an experimental implementaion of the transducer pattern for Ruby;
- [applicative-rb](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/applicative-rb) is an experimental implementaion of applicative functors for Ruby;
- [natural_dsl](https://github.com/DmitryTsepelev/natural_dsl) is an experimental DSL for building _natural–language_ DSLs.

Also, I contribute to various open–source projects ([Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ADmitryTsepelev+), [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ADmitryTsepelev+), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-styles/-/merge_requests/95#note_736251081), [yarp](https://github.com/ruby/yarp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3ADmitryTsepelev) and [many more](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ADmitryTsepelev+archived%3Afalse+is%3Apublic)).
