description: 'How to detect a possible memory bloat in Rails before it starts being a problem'
---

One year ago, on March 23 I rolled out a first article to this blog, and, looking back, it was a damn good decision! In this short post I'll share some results and stats.

## Overall

During the year I published _12 posts_: 8 about Rails, 2 about Haskell, 1 about databaseas and 1 essay about architecture. Overall there were _26 300 unique visitors_. Thanks for the attention ðŸ™‚

## Top articles

### ðŸ¥‡ [Why Ruby has symbols](/why-has-ruby-symbols)

A post about Ruby internals, rolled out in April, which got most attention: about 11 000 unique visitors spending 5 minutes 30 seconds on the page! Moreover, it was [translated](https://techracho.bpsinc.jp/hachi8833/2022_04_28/117351) to Japaneese, recognized as [one of most popular](https://rubyweekly.com/issues/634) posts in RubyWeekly and reached #4 on Hackernews.

### ðŸ¥ˆ [Understading why attr_accessor in Ruby is faster than a regular method](/attr-accessor-in-ruby)

Another post on how Ruby works, which was rolled out in June. This one got 3 500 unique visitors with 4 minutes 45 seconds on the page.

### ðŸ¥‰ [How to make Ruby interpreter run program written in a natural language](/natural-language-programming-with-ruby)

A weird post about metaprogramming, that was visited by 2 300 unique users, and it took them 3 minutes 22 seconds in average to dig into it.
